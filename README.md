# PATH2iot

The PATH2iot platform presents a new approach to distributed data analytics for Internet of Things applications. It automatically partitions and deploys stream-processing computations over the available infrastructure (e.g. sensors, field gateways, clouds and the networks that connect them) so as to meet non-functional requirements including network limitations and energy.
